# RedditPersonaProject
This project analyzes a Reddit user's posts and comments to generate a user persona based on their tone, interests, and writing style.
It uses the:
-The Reddit API to fetch user data
-HuggingFace Transformers (`t5-small`) to summarize posts/comments
-A rule-based engine to categorize traits

# Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

Main libraries used:
-`praw` (Reddit API)
-`python-dotenv` (to load `.env`)
-`transformers` (for summarization)
-`torch` (required backend for transformers)


# Environment Setup
You need a `.env` file in your root directory.
Hereâ€™s how it should look (refer to `.env.example`):
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent_here

How to Run the Script

You will be prompted to enter a Reddit profile URL, such as:
https://www.reddit.com/user/spez/

The script will:
1. Fetch the user's recent Reddit activity
2. Analyze the tone, writing style, and topics
3. Generate a user persona
4. Save the output in a `.txt` file named like `spez_persona.txt`
